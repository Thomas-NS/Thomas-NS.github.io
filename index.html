						<p>Planet Cube is a work-in-progress application which uses Three.js to simulate a fully functional 3D model of a rubix cube. The cube can be manipulated, randomly shuffled, automatically solved and reset to its original state.<br><br>
						Currently, the solving feature is a bit of a shortcut as it simply does the moves made in reverse, until it is solved. I am currently working on improving this feature by implementing a solving algorithm. I also plan to add a help button, start button, timer, improve the move counter and change the controls to be more intuitive.</p>

Once you click start, your task is repeat the sequences of flashing lights which will keep getting longer and faster. You have 5 seconds to repeat the sequence each round. The number displayed on the right shows your current score and the number on the left shows your high score.</p>

Recommendations can be personalized by selecting the appropriate age range. Each section will display a colour depending on serving number; yellow if it is below the recommended range, green if it is within, and red if it exceeds the range.</p>

			<p>I am based in Ireland and I am currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science and Software Engineering. I have a particular interest in full-stack web development and I love to create clean and functional websites. Although I am currently focusing on web development, I am very eager to explore new fields and diversify my skills. At the moment, I'm sharpening my java abilities and learning the Spring framework.
			<br><br>
			Other than coding, I am very passionate about all things nature, and I love learning about topics such as entomology, mycology and conservation. I regularly contribute by volunteering at a local community garden and working with a volunteer group to maintain our local area. I am always looking for other ways to contribute and help to preserve biodiversity and our environment.
			<br><br>
			Another interest of mine is art. I have been making art for as long as I remember, using all kinds of different mediums, including traditional and digital drawing, painting, sculpting, and recently, pixel art. My goal is to blend my artistic and coding skills to create well-designed solutions that help people with their problems.
